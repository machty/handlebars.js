# WARNING: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FORK OF THE HANDLEBARS PARSER ONLY, PLEASE DON'T TRY TO USE FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS

See the original repo [here](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js).

I've updated the [docs](https://github.com/sclaxton/handlebars.js/blob/master/docs/compiler-api.md#user-content-statements-addendum-sclaxton) to reflect the changes I've made to the parser.
